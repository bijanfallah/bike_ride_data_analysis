## by Bijan Fallah


## Dataset

> The Baywheels offers all residents of the Bay Area an affordable, accessible, and fun new transportation option. Low-income residents qualify for a discounted membership  https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels . They provide their data freely accessibale for data analysis. 


## Summary of Findings

- There is a weekly cycle in bike rides from 2018 to 2020-07. During weekend people will rent less and they rent the bike for going to work maybe.
- The peak belongs to Tuesday, Wendesday and Thursday. There might be people who do not have a full time job? 
- The results show that during 2019 the morning and afternoon peaks were higher in number of rentals. However, for all years there exists the morning and afternoon peaks. Which might point to the time people go to work (7 am) and come back from work (4 pm).
- There existed a boom in bikesharing in 2020 during the pandemie. 
- There is an increase at the begining of 2020, following with a drop in April 2020, maybe because of the pandemie!
- People are using the rides to commute and not for sight-seeing and descovering the city. Which means less tourists in the area. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

> My main focus would be on 1- temporal and 2- spacial distribution of rents and ride duration which bring money for the company. 
> I found the diurnal cycles and the weekly cycles very interesting and the fact that the duration for rides over 1 hour increased during the Pandemie. Which shows an increase in tourism.
